Clock Patience web app
======================

This is a web app that will allow you to play [clock patience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_patience).
It's a simple game. Wikipedia describe it as:

> This is a game of zero skill and is a purely mechanical process.
> The chances of winning are 1 in 13. There is no possible way to
> win the game if none of the bottommost cards in the twelve circle
> piles at the start of play is a king.

There's a bit of zen to it.

I'm building this app to learn more about writing apps for [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS).


TODO
----

* UI design
* build system
* QA: syntax checking and tests
* drag and drop cards
* display clock layout
* enforce rules should be optional (drag and drop)
* auto play (like a cruise control)
* support 'Watch' variation

|    1 | It's easy to make a Firefox OS app (way easier than a Firefox extension). Also, there are css at-rules for device orientation! |
|    2 | Drag and drop. There's more to it than you would initially think.                                                              |
